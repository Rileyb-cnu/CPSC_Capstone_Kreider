This repo contains all of the files that I have personally worked on.
Unfortunately, GitHub did not support my upload of my entire Android
project, as there were over 100 files.

Networking test:
Server.java- a simple server to demonstrate networking
Client.java- a simple client to pass data to the server

myapplication:
AboutActivity.java- the About page class for my application
ContactInfo.java- class for Contact page
ExampleDialog.java- class for the submenu for setting the timer's time
MainActivity.java- largest class, holds timer and implements ExampleDialog
ChatFunction.java- should have been deleted- I do not know how to remove it
		   from the repo, so please ignore this.

res: holds anything that the main classes will use; of particular importance are the layout and menu files
layout- this folder holds all of the XML files for the classes listed above. They
	place all of the parts (i.e. buttons, textfields) in the application.
menu- holds a simple menu for the menu bar at the top.
